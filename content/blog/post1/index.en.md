First blog post - Keep it simple!

## The Context

As part of a project at the **IUT of Lens**, we had to create a portfolio site with **Hugo**. Having already used this static site generator before, I knew its capabilities... but also its limitations in terms of available themes.

## The Problem

After browsing the Hugo theme gallery, none really matched my vision. Either too generic, not modern enough, or with features that didn't fit my specific developer portfolio needs.

## The Solution: Creating Mine

Rather than compromising, I decided to develop my own theme from scratch. This approach allowed me to:

- Control every aspect of the design
- Optimize performance according to my needs
- Integrate exactly the features I wanted
- Learn Hugo architecture in depth

## The Tools That Saved Me

I won't lie: AI was a precious ally in this project:

- **DeepSeek** helped me considerably with **Tailwind CSS** documentation and component layout
- **ChatGPT** guided me on the specific Hugo file hierarchy

This human-machine collaboration allowed me to focus on business logic and design rather than wasting time on syntax.

## The Result

A personalized, modern theme perfectly adapted to my portfolio needs. More importantly: a deep understanding of Hugo that I would never have had using an existing theme.
